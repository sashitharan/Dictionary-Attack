# Dictionary Attack
An attempt to crack a set of users passwords based on the given shadowfile. 

Passwords hosted from my github through an API: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/sashitharan/dictionaryattack-api-server/db 

The salted passwords look like: 

```
alice:$5$jqcjl$f5f099e0ad6e2f5204688ebe83a59175dda9f1d1b542269fd69f7a8530242495
```

# Analysis

Since each string corresponds to a line in the /etc/shadow file format used in Linux or UNIX- like system to store user credentials in encrypted format, the lines will be easier to interpret out of.

Based on the understanding, we can derive the first 2 fields which are the password and salt with reference to figure 1. The password string can be split according to the format $id$salt$hashed. 

The strings are split into 4 colour codes for better understanding,  it is the username followed by a colon as the fields are separated using a colon (:) symbol. Moving on, the $5$ where it the $id used in the password format on the Linux system to identify the algorithm used. Hence in this case, $5$ reciprocates to a SHA-256 algorithm. Thirdly, the salt used with the original input of the user password to form the hash.

## Execution
The file was tackled using a dictionary attack implemented in Java, with 5 classes, Main.java, ResponseJSON.java, HashUtils.java, AnswerJSON.java and Solutions.java. 

The uploaded JSON file, CrackedPasswords.json, was generated using these classes.

### Dictionary File
As the name of the attack suggests, a file containing a dictionary of words were needed in order to create my set of salted hashes from the dictionary file. The dictionary file was outsourced and the file English.txt was downloaded.

### Gson Library
The third-party library, Gson was used in this program. The Gson library used to assist in facilitating a smooth parsing of the JSON file with the java program. Adding on, the java Class MessageDigest was also used by creating one-way hash functions with the dictionary words and salts with the SHA-256 algorithm. The hash was used in comparison with the provided hashed passwords to decrypt the passwords.

### Consideration for a Rainbow Attack
Hash tables were used to recover as many passwords as possible from the dictionary and in scenarios where passwords are not found, a rainbow table approach will be used to decipher the remaining passwords. However, there wasn’t a need for a rainbow table hence, rainbow table attack was avoided, and the dictionary attack with hash tables was used throughout in this case.

### Final Solution
The final solution of the resolved passwords are attached in the JSON file named CrackedPasswords.json
